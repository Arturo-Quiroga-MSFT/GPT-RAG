## Solution Architecture

The solution leverages a **Zero Trust Architecture** to ensure maximum security and compliance. All components are securely integrated within a virtual network, and communication between services is strictly controlled.

![Zero Trust Architecture](../media/architecture-GPT-RAG-ZeroTrust-LZ.png)
*Zero Trust Architecture*

The diagram above illustrates the Zero Trust architecture. The **GPT-RAG Solution Accelerator** scope encompasses components within the **Enterprise RAG** resource group, providing essential Zero Trust functionalities.

### Key Resources

- **Virtual Network (VNet):** Isolates resources and controls inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Azure App Service:** Hosts the front-end application.
- **Azure Functions:** Executes serverless functions for data ingestion and orchestration.
- **Azure Storage Account:** Stores data blobs for retrieval.
- **Azure AI Search:** Indexes and searches data efficiently.
- **Azure OpenAI:** Generates responses and vector embeddings.
- **Azure AI Services:** Reads documents for data Ingestion.
- **Azure CosmosDB:** Stores conversation history and metadata to improve quality.
- **Azure Key Vault:** Manages secrets used by the solution.
- **Azure Private Endpoints:** Secures network communication between services.
- **Data Science VM:** Provides a secure Bastion environment for admins and developers to configure the solution.

For more information about Zero Trust architecture, see the [Enterprise RAG (GPT-RAG) Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) page.

## Data Ingestion

Data ingestion is a crucial part of the solution, enabling the system to retrieve accurate and up-to-date information.

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Documents are ingested from `documents` blob container in the GPT-RAG storage account.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The documents are prepared for indexing in AI Search Index, including breaking them into smaller chunks and optimizing them for efficient searchability.
3. **Indexing for Search:** The chunks are then indexed within Azure AI Search, allowing for efficient and accurate retrieval during query processing.

> [!NOTE]  
> The data ingestion process is scheduled to run every hour. It uses a pull approach where an Azure AI Search indexer leverages a custom Web API skill, running as a Function App, to handle preprocessing and apply tailored chunking strategies specific to each document type before indexing.

For more information about the data ingestion process take a look at the [GPT-RAG ingestion](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ingestion) function app repo.

## Orchestration Flow

The solution uses an **Agentic Orchestration** approach, enabling agents to operate autonomously for efficient handling of user requests. The orchestration flow described below provides a typical structure but can be tailored to meet specific requirements.

### How It Works

1. **User Interaction:** The user submits a query through the front-end application.
2. **Orchestration Process:** The Orchestrator initiates a group chat with specialized agents to address the query.
   - Agents retrieve relevant data from an AI Search index or a SQL database.
   - The GPT model generates a response based on the collected information.
3. **Response Delivery:** The front-end application returns a grounded answer to the user.

> [!NOTE]  
> The orchestrator runs as a Function App, ensuring scalable and efficient agent orchestration.

For more information about the agentic orchestration take a look at the [GPT-RAG orchestration](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-agentic) function app repo.

## Network Components

The networking architecture for the GPT-RAG solution leverages Azureâ€™s advanced features to ensure a secure, flexible, and isolated environment, adhering to Zero Trust principles through the use of private endpoints and stringent access controls.

1. **Azure Virtual Network (VNet):** Provides a logically isolated network environment, segmented into subnets for different application tiers, ensuring organized and secure deployment of resources.
    
2. **Azure Private Link and Private Endpoints:** Establish secure, private connections to Azure services, keeping traffic within the Microsoft backbone network and minimizing exposure to the public internet.
    
3. **Private DNS Zones:** Enable internal name resolution within the Virtual Network, ensuring secure communication between services without public exposure.
    
4. **Network Security Groups (NSGs):** Control and restrict inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources with granular security rules, enhancing the protection of your network.
    
5. **Azure Bastion:** Provides secure access for the development team to the VM used for GPT-RAG deployment via the Azure portal, without exposing it to the internet, ensuring secure and controlled deployment activities.

> [!NOTE]  
> The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates provided in this solution accelerator enable automated, customizable provisioning of networking resources, ensuring alignment with your organization's naming conventions and address range standards. Alternatively, you may also opt to provision these resources manually if preferred.

> [!NOTE]  
> **DNS Configuration Options:** This solution accelerator configures Azure Private DNS Zones to enable seamless resolution of private endpoints within the resource group. If your organization requires customized DNS settings, you have the option to manage private DNS zones independently, integrate with on-premises DNS servers, or configure conditional forwarders as needed. For more details, refer to [Private Endpoint DNS Integration scenarios](https://github.com/dmauser/PrivateLink/tree/master/DNS-Integration-Scenarios).

To enable access to the solution accelerator, **external users** can connect through **Azure Front Door** with a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**, ensuring secure and managed traffic. For **internal users**, access can be configured through **VNet Peering** with secure connectivity via **VPN** or **ExpressRoute**.

Alternatively, internal users may connect using additional **Private Endpoints** for both the web application and storage account within an accessible Virtual Network. Further details on configuring these options will be provided later in the document.

<!-- *Refer to the Solution Architecture diagram for a visual representation.* -->

## Access Control

### Authentication

The solution utilizes **Azure Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory) for authenticating users accessing the front-end application. This ensures secure access control and integration with organizational identity management.

### Authorization

Authorization is managed by defining specific Entra ID users and groups that are permitted to use the application. These allowed users and groups are configured directly in the App Service settings, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to the application.

# Common Administrative Tasks and Procedures

This section provides step-by-step guides for essential tasks.

  - **Virtual Machine Contributor** role or higher on the resource group containing the Bastion and VM.
  
- **Access Credentials:**
  - Access to the Azure Key Vault containing the Bastion credentials.
  
### **Procedure**

Follow these steps to securely connect to the Data Science VM through Azure Bastion:

#### **Step 1: Access the Azure Portal**

#### **Step 2: Locate the Virtual Machine Resource**

1. **Go to the Bastion blade:**
   
   - In the Azure Bastion overview page, log into the created VM with the user **gptrag** and authenticate with the password stored in the key vault, similar to the figure below:  

   ![Bastion Connection Screen](../media/readme-keyvault-login.png)
   *Bastion Connection Interface*

> [!NOTE]
> The Data Science VM accessed through Bastion is intended solely for administrators and configuration personnel and is not meant for end-users. It is designed for individuals responsible for configuring, customizing, or updating the solution.

## Internal User Access

Provide user access to internal users via secure network configurations.

### Configuring VNET Peering

Establish VNET Peering to enable secure and efficient communication between virtual networks for users within a private network connected via ExpressRoute or VPN. This configuration ensures that internal users can seamlessly access the application's frontend and storage services.

![Diagram illustrating VNET Peering](../media/admin-guide-vnet-peering-diagram.png)

#### **Pre-requisites**

- **Azure Permissions:**
  - **Network Contributor** role or higher on both virtual networks involved in the peering.

- **Network Configuration:**
  - Ensure that the virtual networks do not have overlapping IP address spaces.
  - Both virtual networks must reside within the same Azure region or supported regions for peering.

#### **Procedure**

For step-by-step configuration instructions, refer to the [Create a VNET Peering Procedure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-peering?tabs=peering-portal).

### Configuring Private Endpoints

Implement Private Endpoints for **App Service** and **Storage Accounts** to provide secure and streamlined access for users connected through ExpressRoute or VPN. This approach offers an alternative to VNET Peering by allowing private connectivity to specific services without exposing them to the public internet.

![Diagram illustrating Private Endpoints](../media/admin-guide-private-endpoints-diagram.png)

#### **Pre-requisites**

- **Azure Permissions:**
  - **Network Contributor** or **Private Endpoint Contributor** role on the virtual network where the private endpoint will be deployed.
  - **Contributor** role or higher on the App Service and Storage Account resources.

- **Network Configuration:**
  - Ensure DNS settings are configured to resolve the private endpoints correctly.
  - Verify that the virtual network has sufficient IP address space to accommodate the private endpoints.

#### **Procedure**
  
For detailed configuration guidance for App Service, see the [Connect privately to an App Service apps using private endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-private-endpoint). The steps for creating a private endpoint for a Storage Account are similar to those for App Service.

## External User Access

Provide user access to external users via secure network configurations.

### Configuring Front Door and Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Configure **Azure Front Door** in conjunction with a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to manage external user access. This setup provides global load balancing, ensures high availability, and protects the application from common web threats and vulnerabilities.

<!-- ![Diagram illustrating Front Door and WAF](path/to/front-door-waf-diagram.png) -->

#### Procedure

To set up Front Door and WAF, follow the instructions in the [Create an Azure Front Door using Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/create-front-door-portal) page.

#### **Alternative Deployment Option**

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, Front Door and WAF can be deployed within the same Subscription and resource group as GPT-RAG to streamline the configuration process.


### Configuring IP Allowlist

With the **Private Endpoint** already set up for **App Service**, you can still configure an IP allowlist for specific cases, such as temporary access to the frontend for quick testing. This setup ensures that only trusted sources with pre-approved IPs can access the service publicly when necessary.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Use this approach for short-term access, such as quick testing or setup for a small group of users. Itâ€™s a simple control but relies on a public endpoint, so apply it only when necessary for specific cases.

#### **Pre-requisites**

- **Azure Permissions:**
  - **Contributor** role or higher on the Azure subscription or the specific resource group containing the App Service.

- **Network Configuration:**
  - A list of trusted IP addresses or ranges that will be allowed access to the public endpoints.

## Setting Up Git Repos

The GPT-RAG Solution Accelerator comprises four Git repositories, each housing the code for specific application components. Whether you're using GitHub, Azure Repos in Azure DevOps, or another Git service, this section outlines the organization of the codebase and provides instructions for integrating it into your own Git repositories. You can incorporate the Solution Accelerator's code into your Git repositories either by using the repositories as templates or by forking and then creating pull requests in case you want to contribute to the Open Source project.

### Codebase Organization

The Solution Accelerator is structured across four primary Git repositories:

1. **gpt-rag**: The main repository containing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Bicep templates and comprehensive documentation for the Solution Accelerator.
2. **gpt-rag-ingestion**: Manages the Data Ingestion component, optimizing data chunking and indexing for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieval step.
3. **gpt-rag-agentic**: Serves as the orchestrator, coordinating the flow to retrieve information and generate user responses using Agentic and AutoGen agents.
4. **gpt-rag-frontend**: Provides the front-end application, delivering a scalable and efficient web interface for the Solution Accelerator.

### Option 1: Using Repositories as Templates (Most Common)

If you'd like to use the repositories as a starting point without making updates to the original, you can use GitHub's template feature. This will create an independent copy of the repository, which you can fully customize. However, keep in mind that this option wonâ€™t automatically sync with future updates from the original repository.

> **Note:** The following steps should be performed for each of the four Solution Accelerator repositories: **gpt-rag**, **gpt-rag-ingestion**, **gpt-rag-agentic**, and **gpt-rag-frontend**.
